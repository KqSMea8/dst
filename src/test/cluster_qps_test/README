2. add test cases in TEST_CASES variable(in run_test.py) list
3. modify time intervals(SUBMIT_INTERVAL variable) between each submit
4. run: 'python run_test.py submit'

Get QPS/Latency statistics
1. modify HTTP_INTERFACE variable to your WEBAPP's url
2. run: 'python run_test.py analyze appid1 appid2 ...'
3. all results will be saved in ./data/ folder as csv format

Kill Job:
1. run: 'python run_test.py kill appid1 appid2 ...'

Note:
1. run_test.py uses conf/dstream.cfg.xml to determine which cluster to submit, modify conf/dstream.cfg.xml before use it.

2. importer runs in fake mode as default

3. run_test.py uses data from webapp's mysql database, so make sure you have started 'counter monitor' before run test cases.
