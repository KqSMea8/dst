<h1>
Run-Time Errors
</h1>
<P>
A BullseyeCoverage probe or function <a href=ref_cov_write.html>cov_write</a>
may report one of the following error codes to the user or to
the file named by environment variable
<a href="ref_environment.html#COVERR">COVERR</a>,
if set.
<p>
<table summary="Run-time error codes and descriptions">
<tr><th>Code<th>Description

<tr><td>0<td>
Success.
<tr><td>1<td>
Memory corrupted in the instrumentation area.
Add calls to <a href=ref_cov_check.html>cov_check</a> to your program to determine where the memory error first occurs.
<tr><td>2<td>
Wrong coverage file.
The instrumented code contains information far different than the coverage file.
Use the same coverage file at run-time as was last updated by building the instrumented code.
Check the <code>COVFILE</code> and <code>COVFILELIST</code> environment variables.
Under Windows, after changing environment variables, restart all command prompts and IDEs.
If you copy the test program from a different computer, also copy the coverage file at the same time.
<tr><td>3<td>
File lock error.
See <a href="trouble_fileLock.html">File Lock Error</a>.
<tr><td>4<td>
Object missing.
The instrumented code contains information about a version of an object file that is not present in this coverage file.
Possibly, the object file was overwritten during the build.
Enable <a href=ref_covc.html>covc</a> option <code>--retain</code> and rebuild.
To do this in the <a href=coverageBrowser.html>Coverage Browser</a>,
use menu command <code>Tools Options</code> and enable <code>Retain previous measurements when possible</code>.
If <code>--retain</code> does resolve this error,
delete all copies of the object file named in the error message,
all libraries which might contain the object file,
and delete the executable file named in the error message, if any.
If this error persists, see the suggestions for error #2.
<tr><td>5<td>
A low-level i/o operation failed, such as <code>read</code>,
<code>write</code>, <code>lseek</code>, or <code>close</code>.
Check hardware or network connection.

<tr><td>6<td>The coverage file is corrupted.
Rebuild the test program with <a href=build_coverageBuild.html>Coverage
Build</a> enabled.

<tr><td>7<td>
The test program does not match the coverage file.
Rebuild the test program with <a href=build_coverageBuild.html>Coverage
Build</a> enabled.
Set environment variable <code>COVFILE</code> to the full path of the
coverage file to make certain you have only one coverage file.
Unset environment variable <code>COVFILELIST</code> if it exists.

<tr><td>8<td>
Function atexit failed.
On Windows, make sure the <code>TMP</code> environment variable specifies a valid, writable directory.
Remove the files <code>BullseyeCoverage*.dll</code>, from this directory.

<tr><td>12<td>
Entry missing in coverage file.
Set environment variable <code>COVFILE</code> to the full path of the
coverage file to make certain you have only one coverage file.
Enable <code><a href=ref_covc.html>covc</a></code> option <code>--retain</code>.
To do this in <a href=coverageBrowser.html>Coverage Browser</a>, do
<code>Tools Options Build</code> and select <code>Retain previous
measurements when possible</code>.
Under Windows, set <code>COVFILE</code> in the
Control Panel then restart all command prompts.
Verify
the coverage file is the same one created when building.  If you copy
the test program from a different computer, also copy the coverage file.
Unset environment variable <code>COVFILELIST</code> if it exists.
If the suggestions above do not help to resolve this error, delete all
copies of the object file named in the error message, all libraries
which might contain the object file, and delete the executable file
named in the error message, if any.
After version 7.8.24, this error was split into #2 and #4.

<tr><td>13<td>
The auto-save feature is not supported under this operating system.
Disable auto-save by setting environment variable
<a href=ref_environment.html>COVAUTOSAVE</a>
to <code>0</code>.

<tr><td>14<td>
No new probes have been encountered since the last call to cov_write.
Removed in version 7.12.3.

<tr><td>15<td>
Cannot find coverage file.
<code>COVFILE</code> is not set.
Set environment variable <code>COVFILE</code> to the full path of the
coverage file.

<tr><td>16<td>
Cannot open coverage file.
<code>COVFILE</code> is probably set to an incorrect path.
Set environment variable <code>COVFILE</code> to the full path of the
coverage file that you used when building.

<tr><td>17<td>
Coverage file is empty; it contains no coverage measurement information.
This file was probably created or emptied with the <code>covmgr</code> command.
Set <code>COVFILE</code> to the full path of this coverage file, enable
Coverage Build and rebuild all.
Unset environment variable <code>COVFILELIST</code> if it exists.

<tr><td>18<td>
Not a BullseyeCoverage file or wrong version.
The <code>COVFILE</code> environment variable specifies a file which is
either not a file created by BullseyeCoverage, or was written by an incompatible
version of BullseyeCoverage.
Check that <code>COVFILE</code> specifies the full path of the coverage
file most recently created by BullseyeCoverage when you built the test program
with Coverage Build enabled.

<tr><td>19<td>
Passive mode run-time.
Function <code>cov_write</code> returns this error code when using a passive
kernel mode version of the BullseyeCoverage run-time library.
You must use <a href=ref_covgetkernel.html>covgetkernel</a> to save
measurements.

<tr><td>20<td>
No probes have been encountered. There is no data to save.

<tr><td>21<td>
Environment variable <a href=ref_environment.html>COVNOSAVE</a> is set.  No coverage was saved.

<tr><td>22<td>
Function <code>cov_write</code> is busy.
Function <code>cov_write</code> returned immediately because a previous caller
in another thread was busy in <code>cov_write</code>
and it was not possible to wait for the previous caller to finish.
