How do I interpret condition/decision coverage numbers?</h2>
<p>
The condition/decision coverage number is the sum of the following.
<ul>
<li>The number of true/false outcomes of each condition and each decision
<li>The number of switch labels selected
<li>The number of C++ try-blocks that finished with no exception
<li>The number of C++ catch clauses entered
</ul>
<p>
The condition/decision coverage percentage is the ratio of the number of
events described above divided by the total possible.
<p>
Because conditions are always contained within decisions, there is some
overlap in the measurement which may result in larger numbers than you
might expect.
For example,
consider the code fragment below.
<pre>
if (a &amp;&amp; b)
</pre>
<p>
BullseyeCoverage reports coverage as <i>n</i>/6 although only 3 possible
combinations of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> exist.
Condition/decision coverage counts the two possible outcomes (true and
false) for each of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and the overall
decision outcome, for a total of 6 possible events.
<p>
If the first test case you choose to exercise this fragment is
<code>a</code> = false, the condition/decision coverage is 2/6=33%
(<code>a</code> = false, <code>b</code> not evaluated, and decision
outcome false).
However if the first test case you choose is <code>a</code> = true
<code>b</code> = false, the condition/decision coverage is 3/6=50%.
Condition/decision coverage reports lower coverage when <code>b</code>
is not evaluated.
<p>
For a detailed discussion of condition/decision coverage and other coverage
measures, see

How do I merge coverage files?</h2>
<p>
You can merge coverage files that created in the same directory and refer to the same versions of source files.
You can do this with:
<ul>
<li> with the
<a href=coverageBrowser.html>Coverage Browser</a>
command <code>File Insert</code>, or
<li> with the command line program
<a href=ref_covmerge.html>covmerge</a>.
</ul>
<p>
For example, to use covmerge to merge two files into a new file you can use
the command below.
<pre>
covmerge -c -f output.cov input1.cov input2.cov
</pre>
<hr>

How do I compare coverage files?</h2>
<p>
You can compare coverage files by generating text reports from the
coverage files and then using a text file comparator such as Unix-style
<code>diff</code> or the Windows <code>fc.exe</code>.
When generating the text reports, sort by region name to minimize differences.
<p>
You can compare the coverage of two coverage files by directory using
the commands below.
<pre>
covdir --by-name -f file1.cov >file1.txt
covdir --by-name -f file2.cov >file2.txt
diff file1.txt file2.txt
</pre>

How do I export coverage data?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Coverage Browser menu command <code>File Export as XML</code>
<li>The Coverage Browser menu command <code>Edit Copy</code>.
To copy all coverage measurements, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>From the <code>View</code> menu, choose the <code>Queries</code> command
<li>Select the query named <code>all regions</code>
<li>Press the tab key to move the focus to the right-side pane
<li>From the <code>Edit</code> menu, choose <code>Select All</code>
<li>From the <code>Edit</code> menu, choose <code>Copy</code>
<li>In the destination program, use <code>Edit Paste</code>
</ol>
<li>The Coverage Browser menu command <code>File Save View as HTML</code>.
To save all coverage measurements, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>From the <code>View</code> menu, choose the <code>Queries</code> command
<li>Select the query named <code>all regions</code>
<li>From the <code>File</code> menu, choose <code>Save View as HTML</code>
</ol>
<li>The <a href=ref-covxml.html>covxml</a> command
<li>
Use option <code>--csv</code> with <a href=ref_covbr.html>covbr</a>,
<a href=ref_summary.html>covclass, covdir, covfn, or covsrc</a>
</ul>
<p>
The Coverage Browser command <code>Edit Copy</code>
uses HTML format and rich text format (RTF) as well as plain text format
to preserve graphics and formatting.
<p>
To export coverage data at the command line, you must use the command shell
redirection syntax <code>&gt;</code>.  For example,
<pre>
covfn --base --by-name --csv >functionReport.txt
</pre>

Can BullseyeCoverage measure statement coverage?</h2>
<p>
No.
See also <a href="http://www.bullseye.com/statementCoverage.html">What is Wrong with Statement Coverage</a>.
<hr>
<h2>

How are C++ templates handled?</h2>
<p>
BullseyeCoverage measures coverage in template functions the same way as regular functions.
Coverage is measured by instrumenting the source code.
Therefore, all template coverage in all instantiations is combined and reported together.
<hr>
<h2>
<a name=9></a>
How are macros handled?</h2>
<p>
By default, BullseyeCoverage does not instrument code resulting from macro expansions.
You can enable instrumentation of macro expansions with
<a href=ref_covc.html>covc</a>
option <code>--macro</code>.
<p>
The rationale for not measuring macro expansions is that macros often contain logic
that is impossible to fully cover at every invocation.
These impossible paths add up quickly with each invocation, producing a large
amount of unreachable code that overwhelms coverage measurements of the
surrounding code.
<p>
We recommend using inline functions rather than macros where possible.

Does BullseyeCoverage work with Xoreax IncrediBuild?</h2>
<p>
Xoreax IncrediBuild 3.10 and later is compatible with BullseyeCoverage.
Xoreax achieved compatibility with BullseyeCoverage by building non-distributed when BullseyeCoverage is enabled.

Can BullseyeCoverage be qualified for DO-178B?</h2>
<p>
Bullseye Testing Technology has partnered with
the aviation verification services firm
<a href="http://www.certtech.com/">CertTech</a>
to provide qualification support for FAA Order 8110.49 / RTCA DO-178B.
<p>
The coverage measurement provided by BullseyeCoverage meets the DO-178B requirements.
For level C, DO-178B requires statement coverage.
BullseyeCoverage does not measure statement coverage,
however if you achieve full decision or condition/decision coverage
and your code does not use any facility that might interrupt execution before the end of a basic block, such as
exception handling,
then all statements are covered.
For level B, DO-178B requires decision coverage and statement coverage.
BullseyeCoverage can report decision coverage directly.
For level A, DO-178B requires MC/DC and statement coverage.
BullseyeCoverage measures condition/decision coverage, which is equivalent to MC/DC for C and C++.
<p>
For C and C++, MC/DC is equivalent to condition/decision coverage.
This is because C and C++ use short circuit logical operators.
The definition of MC/DC implies that a truth table report is required,
but full condition/decision coverage is achieved by the same tests as full MC/DC
for C and C++.
MC/DC was created with languages such as Ada in mind that have logical operators
that do not short-circuit (in addition to those that do short-circuit).
The "modified" part of MC/DC is focused on reducing the exponential number of
tests required for very complex Boolean expressions using non-short circuit
operators.
But by definition short circuit operators never evaluation a condition if it
does not affect the decision outcome.
If you only use short-circuit operators, and you exercise all conditions, you
must have demonstrated that they affect the decision outcome.

Can BullseyeCoverage output HTML?</h2>
<p>
BullseyeCoverage can create simple HTML reports with the <a href=coverageBrowser.html>Coverage Browser</a>
menu command <code>File Save View as HTML</code>
and with the command line report programs <a href=ref_summary.html>covclass, covdir, covfn, covsrc</a> and
<a href=ref_covbr.html>covbr</a> option <code>--html</code>.
The resulting HTML has no links and is intended for taking a static snapshot.
To browse the coverage information dynamically requires using the Coverage Browser,
which has many options for sorting, navigating and searching.

<hr>
<h2>
<a name=12></a>
Can the Coverage Browser save an HTML report containing everything?</h2>
<p>
Yes.
Use the menu command <code>View Queries</code> and enable the query named <code>all regions</code>.
Then use <code>File Save View as HTML</code>.

<hr>
<h2>
<a name=13></a>
Does BullseyeCoverage support C++/CLI?</h2>
<p>
Yes, we support Microsoft C++ option <code>/clr</code> (native mode).
However we cannot support <code>/clr:pure</code> and <code>/clr:safe</code> (MSIL mode)
because those options do not allow our run-time to record the coverage due to security restrictions.
When BullseyeCoverage is invoked with <code>/clr:pure</code> or <code>/clr:safe</code>,
it changes the option to <code>/clr</code>.
BullseyeCoverage does not instrument the <code>for each</code> statement, event definitions, or
property definitions.

Does BullseyeCoverage support Keil uVision?</h2>
<p>
No, the Keil uVision IDE (v3.62c) does not provide a way for BullseyeCoverage to
intercept compile commands.  Additionally, Keil uVision does not provide a way
to view standard output and standard error diagnostic messages.

<hr>
<h2>
<a name=15></a>
Can I disable measurement of switch default labels?</h2>
<p>
BullseyeCoverage has neither an option
to exclude measurement of <code>switch</code>
statement <code>default</code> labels,
nor exclude the branch that occurs when
there is no <code>default</code> label and
the controlling expression matches no <code>case</code> expression.
Although many <code>switch</code> statements are written so that these branches are purposely unreachable,
BullseyeCoverage cannot gauge their importance.
We will not add an option to ignore these branches because the purpose of BullseyeCoverage is to find unreached branches.
<p>
You can exclude switch <code>default</code> labels by inserting BullseyeCoverage pragma directives.
For example:
<pre>
switch (expr) {
case <i>...</i>
case <i>...</i>
<i>...</i>
#pragma BullseyeCoverage save off
}
#pragma BullseyeCoverage restore
</pre>
