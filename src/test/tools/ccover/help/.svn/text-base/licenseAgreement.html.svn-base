INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNITY
<ol><li>
Bullseye Testing Technology shall indemnify, defend and hold Licensee harmless from any claim by a third party that the Software infringes any patent, trade secret,  copyright or other intellectual property right of that third party, provided:  (i) Bullseye Testing Technology is promptly notified of the claim; (ii) Bullseye Testing Technology receives reasonable cooperation from Licensee in protecting its rights related thereto; and (iii) Bullseye Testing Technology has the opportunity to assume sole control over the defense and all negotiations for a settlement or compromise.
Provided that Bullseye Testing Technology complies with its obligations herein, Bullseye Testing Technology will not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing.
The foregoing obligation of Bullseye Testing Technology does not apply with respect to Software or portions or components thereof: (i) not supplied by Bullseye Testing Technology; (ii) used in a manner not expressly authorized by this Agreement if the alleged infringement relates to such use (iii) made in whole or in part in accordance with Licensee's specifications; (iv) modified by Licensee, if the alleged infringement relates to such modification; (v) combined with other products (hardware or software), processes or materials not approved by Bullseye Testing Technology where the alleged infringement would not exist but for such combination; or (vi) where Licensee continues the allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof and provided with modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement.
